# Devise and Profile Tester

Attempting to both create a user profile page as well as an administrative
heirarchy via devise.

### Iteration A

Working Devise structure - 

Have a working admin and user roles, was trying another private iteration where I had admin as
a boolean value and was having some issues.  Want to check my subscription model and look
at how I linked it with devise and try and remove the improperly set up admin role.
